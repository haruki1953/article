1. I'm glad to report that the pad damage is actually quite small" and should "be repaired quickly.

2. The vehicle's structural margins appear to be better than we expected, as we can tell from the vehicle actually doing somersaults towards the end and still staying intact.

3. From a "pad standpoint, we are probably ready to launch in 6 to 8 weeks.

4. The longest item on that is probably requalification of the flight termination system ... it took way too long to rupture the tanks.

5. Time for AFTS to kick in "was pretty long," about "40 seconds-ish.

6. There were 3 engines that we chose not to start," so that's why Super Heavy booster lifted off with 30 engines, "which is the minimum number of engines.

7. The 3 engines "didn't explode," but just were not "healthy enough to bring them to full thrust so they were shut down

8. At T+27 seconds, SpaceX lost communications due to "some kind of energy event." And "some kind of explosion happened to knock out the heat shields of engines 17, 18, 19, or 20.

9. Rocket kept going through T+62 seconds" with the engines continuing to run. Lost thrust vector control at T+85 seconds.

10. Generated a "rock tornado" under Super Heavy during liftoff, but SpaceX does not "see evidence that the rock tornado actually damaged engines or heat shields in a material way." May have happened, but "we have not seen evidence of that.

11. It was actually good to get this vehicle off the ground because we've made so many improvements" in Super Heavy Booster 9 "and beyond."

12. "Really just needed to fly this vehicle and then move on to the much improved booster."

13. After AFTS, "the ship did not attempt to save itself."

14. Big thing for next Starship launch is "insuring that we don't lose thrust vector control" with Booster 9."

15. We're going to putting down a lot of steel" under the launch tower before the next Starship flight.
    "Debris was really just basically sand and rock so it's not toxic at all ... it's just like a sandstorm, essentially ... but we don't want to do that again."

16. We certainly didn't expect" to destroy the concrete under the launchpad.

17. Speculating, but "one of the more plausible explanations is that ... we may have compressed the sand underneath the concrete to such a degree that the concrete effectively bent and then cracked," which is "a leading theory."

18. Reason for going with a steel  plate instead of a flame trench is that for payloads in the rocket, the worse acoustic environment doesn't matter to the payload since it's about 400 feet away.

19. Flight was "pretty close to what I expected."

20. Got pretty close to stage separation ... if we had maintained thrust vector control and throttled up, which we should have ... then we would have made it to staging."

21. Our goal for the next flight is to make it to staging and hopefully succeed."

22. My expectation for the next flight would be to reach orbit." Next flight profile will be a "repeat."

23. The goal of these missions is just information. Like, we don't have any payload or anything -- it's just to learning as much as possible."

24. Definitely don't" expect lunar Starship (under the HLS project) to be the longest lead item for the Artemis III mission.

25. "We will be the first thing to really be" ready.

26. Probably an 80% probability of reaching orbit with Starship this year, and "I think close to 100% change of reaching orbit within 12 months.

27. Slowed down Raptor engine production "because we've got more Raptors than we know what to do with.

28. Expect to spend ~$2 billion this year on Starship.

29. We do not anticipate needing to raise funding ... we don't think we need to raise funding." Will do the "standard thing where we provide liquidity to employees.

30. But to my knowledge we do not need to raise incremental funding for SpaceX.

31. For the next flight, "we're going to start the engines faster and get off the pad faster." From engine start to moving Starship "was around 5 seconds, which is a really long time to be blasting the pad." Going to try to cut that time in half.

32. Starship didn't get to what SpaceX thought was "a safe point to do stage separation.

33. I thought the SpaceX team did amazing work.

34. This is certainly a candidate for the hardest technical problem done by humans.

35. Musk, on environmental response: "The rocket uses non-toxic propellants and ... scattered a lot of dust, but to the best of our knowledge there has not been any meaningful damage to the environment that we're aware of."

36. SpaceX has yet to make a final decision on which Starship prototype and Super Heavy booster will fly the next launch.

37. Going to be replacing a bunch of the tanks in the tank farm, but these are tanks that we wanted to replace anyway.

38. Tower itself is in good shape. We see no meaningful damage to the tower even though they got hit with some pretty big chunks of concrete.

1. 我很高兴地报告说，发射台的损坏实际上非常小，并且应该会很快得到修复。
2. 从我们观察到的火箭实际翻滚并仍保持完整来看，火箭的结构边界似乎比我们预期的要好。
3. 从“发射台的角度来看，我们可能在6到8周内就准备好进行下一次发射了。
4. 最耗时的工作可能是重新验证飞行终止系统...它花费的时间太长了，需要将油箱爆破的时间缩短。
5. AFTS的启动时间“相当长”，大约“40秒左右”。
6. 我们选择不启动了3个发动机，所以超级重型助推器带着30个发动机升空，这是最少的发动机数量。
7. 这3个发动机“没有爆炸”，但只是“不能健康地将它们带到全推力，所以它们被关闭了。”
8. 在T + 27秒时，SpaceX失去了通信，因为发生了“某种能量事件”。而且“某种爆炸导致17、18、19或20号引擎的热屏障受损。
9. 火箭在通过T + 62秒时继续飞行，发动机仍然运转。在T + 85秒时失去了推力矢量控制。
10. 在升空期间，在超级重型助推器下方产生了“岩石龙卷风”，但SpaceX并未“看到证据表明这个岩石龙卷风实际上对发动机或热屏障造成了实质性的损害。”可能已经发生了，但是“我们没有看到这样的证据。”
11. 实际上让这个火箭起飞很好，因为我们在超级重型助推器9及以后做出了很多改进。
12. “真正需要做的就是让这个火箭飞起来，然后继续改进助推器。”
13. AFTS之后，“飞船没有尝试自我拯救”。
14. 下一次Starship的重要事情是确保我们不会失去Booster 9的推力矢量控制。
15. 在下一次Starship飞行之前，我们将在发射塔下面放置很多钢材。“碎片实际上只是沙子和岩石，所以它并不具有毒性...本质上就像沙尘暴...但我们不想再遇到这种情况了。”
16. 今年用Starship到达轨道的概率可能达到80%，在12个月内接近100%。
17. 推测是，“其中一个更有可能的解释是...我们可能将混凝土下面的沙子压缩到了这样的程度，使得混凝土实际上弯曲并裂开”，这是“一种主要的理论”。
18. 之所以选择钢板而不是火焰槽，是因为对于火箭中的载荷来说，更糟糕的声学环境对载荷并不重要，因为它距离火箭大约400英尺远。
19. 这次飞行“非常接近我预期的情况”。
20. 离阶段分离相当接近...如果我们保持了推力矢量控制并加速推力，那么我们就可以成功达到阶段分离。

21. 下一次飞行的目标是实现阶段分离并希望取得成功。
22. 我对下一次飞行的期望是到达轨道。下一次的飞行配置将是“重复”。
23. 这些任务的目标仅仅是获取信息。比如说，我们没有任何载荷或其他物品——仅仅是尽可能多地学习。
24. 肯定不会预计月球Starship（在HLS项目下）是Artemis III任务中最耗时的部分。
25. “我们将是真正准备好的第一件事情。”
26. 今年用Starship到达轨道的概率可能达到80%，在12个月内接近100%。
27. 减缓了Raptor发动机的生产，“因为我们有比我们能处理的更多的Raptor发动机。”
28. 预计今年将在Starship上花费大约20亿美元。
29. 我们不预计需要筹集资金...我们认为我们不需要筹集资金。我们将提供流动性给员工。
30. 但据我所知，我们不需要为SpaceX额外筹集资金。
31. 对于下一次飞行，“我们将加快启动发动机和脱离发射台的速度。”从发动机启动到移动火箭的时间约为5秒，这是在不断喷射高压气体对着发射台的时间很长。我们将尝试将这个时间缩短一半。
32. Starship没有达到SpaceX认为的“安全点”进行阶段分离。
33. 我认为SpaceX团队做得非常出色。
34. 这肯定是人类所面临的最难的技术问题之一。
35. 在环境反应方面，Musk表示：“火箭使用无毒推进剂...散布了很多粉尘，但据我们所知，环境并没有遭受任何重大损害。”
36. SpaceX还没有最终决定哪个Starship原型和超级重型助推器将进行下一次发射。
37. 将更换储罐场中的一堆油箱，但这些油箱我们本来就想更换。
38. 塔本身处于良好状态。即使遭受了一些相当大的混凝土碎片的撞击，我们也没有看到塔上有任何实质性损伤。
